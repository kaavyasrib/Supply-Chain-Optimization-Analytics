# Supply-Chain-Optimization-Analytics
## Overview
This project performs end-to-end supply chain analysis using Python. It generates sample data (or use your own CSV), computes KPIs like inventory turnover and total costs, and visualizes insights to support business decisions in operations and logistics.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-optimization.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python supply_chain_optimization.py`

## Features
- Data processing with Pandas
- KPI calculation (e.g., inventory turnover = sales / inventory)
- Visualizations with Matplotlib (bar charts, scatter plots)
- Optional: Replace sample data with real CSV from Kaggle (e.g., https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirmotefaker/supply-chain-dataset)

## Output
- Printed KPIs
- Saved plots in `output/` folder

## Relevance
Demonstrates automated data pipelines, statistical analysis, and data visualization for supply chain insights.
